# notes-app
An Application using kotlin and espressor integration for ui testing

Language:
  1. Kotlin
  2. Xml
 
Framework:
  1. Espresso for testing
  2. Clean Architecture 
  3. MVVM
 
This appication is a simple note taking app which is developed following MVVM pattern and Espresso is used to write the automated ui testing. I will be working on this repo mainly for declaring some best practices about android development and try to decouple the features as much as possible and also try to make to app more testable.
